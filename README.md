# Intrusion-Detection-System

#### *"Security is my Passion!" - LivingJW30*
Hence, the reasoning behind this project. Everyone wants their privacy. May it be from a nosy sibling or a pesky burglar. This Intrusion Detection System (IDS) was made to counter just this. If someone is where they shouldn't be the IDS will make sure you know. Though a simple design at heart, it is no doubt effective. Let's not forget its low price compared to your average commercial security system. Plus, you get to say you made it yourself!

## The Process
This project is a simple introduction to embedded systems and the basics of circuitry. I truly enjoyed mixing software with hardware to make a system to help with daily life. I also implemented some of the things I have learned in C into Arduino's C++-like language. Items used in the building of this circuit were an Arduino (in this case, I used an ELEGOO Uno), a breadboard, male-to-male wires, LEDs, a 220 Ohm resistor, a buzzer, and an ultrasonic sensor.
