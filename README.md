# Intrusion-Detection-System

#### *"Security is my Passion!" -Jack*
Hence the reasoning behind this project. Everyone wants their privacy. May it be from a nosy sibling or a pesky burgalar. This Intrusion Detection System (IDS) was made to counter just this. If someone is where they shouldn't be the IDS will make sure you know. Though a simple design at heart, it is no doubt effective. Let's not forget its low price compared to your average commercial security system. Plus you get to say you made it yourself!
